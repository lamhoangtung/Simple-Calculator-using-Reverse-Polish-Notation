Simple Calculator using Reverse Polish Notation in Python

## How to run

When **[main.py](main.py)** is running, you will be able to input your expression, the program will evaluate your expression and also plot an Expression Tree to the console and to a **.dot** file:

You can use **dot** tool from the [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) package to render it into a ***.png*** image:

You can also copy all content inside the [**tree.dot**](tree.dot) file and use [Webgprahviz](http://www.webgraphviz.com/) to plot the tree right inside your browser:

#### Dependencies
The code was developed with the following configuration:
* python 3.6.4
* anytree 2.4.3
* graphviz 0.8.4

Other configuration will reasonably work

## Documentation
You can see the details documentation about how I make this calculator in the [notebook file](Simple Calculator using Reverse Polish Notation.ipynb).

## Contributing

Please feels free to contribute to this project, there are a lot of room for improvement, my suggesion are:
* Better Regex for slicing expression
* Evaluate expression using expression tree and DFS
* Making UI (currently running on console)
